  youcube:
    image: ghcr.io/cc-youcube/youcube:latest
    restart: always
    hostname: youcube
    ports:
      - 5000:5000
...
```

### NVIDIA

!!! warning
    Please make sure to install the NVIDIA driver for your GPU before continuing with this installation guide.

Install the NVIDIA driver container toolkit by following [this guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html) by NVIDIA.
Make sure that the YC docker image you're using has NVIDIA in the tag. Please refer to the [tag list](https://github.com/CC-YouCube/server/pkgs/container/youcube/versions?filters%5Bversion_type%5D=tagged) to discover all the available tags.

#### NVIDIA Docker Compose

Add this to services -> youcube in the above-mentioned [docker compose configuration](#docker-compose).

```yaml
runtime: nvidia
```

## Manual Installation

    **Installing YC manually is not recommended due to potential security risks. However, if you still choose to proceed with manual installation, it is important to run the YC server using a user account that has limited permissions. By doing so, you can reduce the potential damage caused by an attacker.**
